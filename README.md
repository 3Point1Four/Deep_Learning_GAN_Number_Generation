# Deep Learning Number Generation

## Overview
This repository contains code for training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images of handwritten digits. The generated images can be customized to correspond to a specified digit. Below are instructions on how to run the code and check the examples.

## Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python (>= 11.5)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Running the Code

1. ### GAN Initialization (GAN_INIT)
   1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
   2. Navigate to the GAN_INIT notebook.
   3. Run GAN_INIT. Please note that GAN_INIT may take approximately 30 minutes to run, but the runtime may vary depending on your hardware.

#OR

1. ### Second GAN Run (GAN_SECOND_RUN)
   1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
   2. Navigate to the GAN_SECOND_RUN notebook.
   3. Run GAN_SECOND_RUN. This notebook contains two runs:
      - The first run may take several hours to train, and the runtime may vary based on your hardware.
      - The second run typically takes approximately 2 hours, but the runtime may vary based on your hardware.

## Checking the Examples

### Input a Specified Digit
- After training the model, you can input a specified digit value.

### DFS Code
1. Run the DFS code.
2. The code will generate output.

### svg_lines_curves_OP
1. Run the svg_lines_curves_OP code.
2. The final output will be saved as SVG files.

Please note that running times may vary depending on your hardware. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out for assistance.

Happy digit generation!
